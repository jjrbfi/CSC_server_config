# Config

- In **/opt/work/** are located the Darknet directory and weights
  
  - **/opt/work/** have 777 rights 

- To connect into the server we have to change the SSH port to **2222** with **-p 2222**

# Installed:

- Nvidia drivers, CUDA and CUDNN

- vim

- libopencv-dev

- opencv-python

- Python3-pip

- python3 -m pip install jupyterlab  **# Each user need to install it in order to get it working individually.**
  - After you installed it. Add this into **.bashrc**:  ```export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"```
  - Highly recommend to put **password** to access into Jupyterlab. Do this the first time you run the jupyterlab.

- nomacs

# nomacs (Image viewer)

If you want to load an image run (Remember X11 flag):
```
nomacs imame.jpg
```

# X11forwarding:

When we run the the predictions we get back a picture with the predictions in coloured boxes and written in the terminal.

In order to get **windows** predicctions over SSH we enabled the X11forwarding.



To get into the SSH with the X11forwarding permissions add the flag **-X** :

```bash
ssh -X name@IP -P 2222
```



# Access into Jupyter-lab:

In case we have multiple users in the server and we will them use jupyterlab, each user need to install jupyterlab and choose a port for each user also as this example:
| Username      | port     |
| :------------- | :----------: |
|  user1 | **8881**   |
| user2   | **8882** |


1. To check if we have Jupyter-lab running you will get back the PID number with this command: ```pgrep jupyter-lab```
   -  In case we don't have jupyter running:

```
cd /opt/work/
jupyter-lab --no-browser --port=8881
```
<img src="images/1.png" alt="image1" width="500"/>



2. Command to run in our computer:
```
ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:localhost:8881 username@server_IP -p 2222
```

<img src="images/2.png" alt="image2" width="500"/>

3. Open browser and type:
```
localhost:8888
```

# Doing a training with **tmux**
If we do a training connected by SSH and we lost the conection, all will be gone.
So using **tmux** we can have a session attached and with can disconect and reconect and we will have the session working all the time until we remove it.

#### Creating a session called "work":
```
tmux new -s work
```

üõ† Now we can run our training ...

#### ‚Ü™Ô∏è To deattach the session press:
Ctrl + b, d

Now we can left the server without any problem üÜí! .

#### ‚Ü©Ô∏è To attach again into the last session use:
Ctrl + b, a
